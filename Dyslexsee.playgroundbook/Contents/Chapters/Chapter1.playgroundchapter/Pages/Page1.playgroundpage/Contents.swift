 # Dyslexsee

 ## What is Dyslexia?

 According to the International Dyslexia Association [here](https://dyslexiaida.org/definition-of-dyslexia/) üìñ

  ---

 *‚ÄúDyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These issue typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.‚Äù*

 ---

 ## How does a person with Dyslexia read? ü§î

 To show this *experience*, I did a **Dyslexia Effect** named **Dyslexsee**, based on interviews with people that are dyslexic. They told that when you try to read a text, the letters look to be **dancing** or **trading**.

 ## How is this experience?

 Generally the most common symptoms of Dyslexia are:

* Letter reversals - **d** for **b**
* Word reversals - **tip** for **pit**
* Inversions - **m** for **w**, **u** for **n**, **6** for **9**
* Transpositions - **felt** for **left**
* Confuse with small words - **at** for **to**, **said** for **and**, **does** for **goes**

 # Goal

 Try to read the text with Dyslexia Effect enabled and type your personal response! üòé

The little boy goes through learning difficulties, where he is not able to read and write. In one of the scenes, his teacher asks him to read a text, and he says he is not able to do it because the letters are ‚Äùdancing‚Äù. When his teacher hears his story, he gets mad and takes his out of the classroom. Everything changes when Ram Shankar Nikumbh, the new teacher, arrives and recognizes that Ishaan has dyslexia and decides to take the boy out from the abyss he was in. He taught Ishaan to read and write regardless of his condition, and from that moment the boy overcomes all the challenges he had and school starts to get a whole new meaning for him. \n \n   Suppose that a few years later Ishaan gets very interested in learning to code and becomes a fan of the development of new technologies. After overcoming several learning obstacles, Ishaan finds a great opportunity to show off his talent: The WWDC 2019 Scholarships! \n \n    What advice would you give to young Ishaan?
